# Spirograph Drawing Application

![Alt Text](screenshot.png)

This is a Python-based application that simulates a spirograph drawing tool using the Pygame library. The application allows the user to create beautiful spirograph patterns, customize the colors, adjust the drawing speed, and save screenshots of their artwork.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Pygame library  

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
2. Install Pygame using pip:  
   `pip install pygame`  

## Running the Application

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `spirograph.py`.  
2. Run the script using Python:  
   `python spirograph.py`  

## Controls

- **Q**: Quit the application.  
- **S**: Save a screenshot of the current spirograph design.  
- **D**: Toggle drawing mode on/off.  
- **C**: Change the pen color to a random color.  
- **H**: Hide/show the outer and inner circles.  
- **+**: Increase the rotation speed.  
- **-**: Decrease the rotation speed.  
- **Enter**: Reinitialize the spirograph with random settings.  

## Features

- Draw spirograph patterns dynamically.  
- Save the current drawing as a screenshot.  
- Change the pen color randomly.  
- Control the speed of the drawing.  
- Toggle between showing or hiding the construction circles.  

## Notes

- Make sure you have Pygame installed before running the script.  
- The screenshots are saved in the same directory as the script with the filename format `screenshot_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.png`.
